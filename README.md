# dnd_dice_roller
A dice roller for dungeons and dragons that can be customized for a character

# End Goal
- have a dice roller where you can select the type of roll you want to make, and it will select the appropriate values to roll
- Like if you want to make an initiative roll, you'd select initiative from the drop down and it will auto select a d20 dice and 
  your initiative modifier
- Each roll will have the option for normal roll, advantage roll, or disadvantage roll; which can be customized to default
  to one of those for each type; like if the character a racial trait or feat for advantage on initiative rolls
- I'd like to have attacks as well; saving number of attacks, weapon type, and bonuses
	- like my current character is a barbarian so it'd be nice to change values weather he's raging or not, giant's mode, savage attacker, etc

# Phase 1 - Saving a Character
- To have customized saved dice rolls, you need a character to start with
- Every character has abilities, saves and skills
- On top of that, a character has a proficiency score which increases as they level
- The character's bonus for a skill or save is based off their ability score
- If a character is proficient in that skill/save, they can also add their proficiency score to that total
- One level above that is expertise in which a character can add their proficiency score twice
