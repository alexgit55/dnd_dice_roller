This module provides classes and functions for simulating dice rolls in a 
Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) context. It includes the Dice class for individual 
dice and the DiceRoller class for rolling multiple dice and calculating 
results.
Classes:
    Dice: Represents a single die with a specified number of sides.
    DiceRoller: Manages the rolling of multiple dice and the calculation of 
    their results.
Functions:
    roll_dice(die_string): Rolls a specified die and returns the result.
Example:
    result = roll_dice("2d6 + 3")
    print(result)
